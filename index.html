      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>From 2021 to 2025, I studied at the AUGSGIP (Academy of Urban Environment Management, Urban Planning and Printing), specializing in Information Technology and Programming. In parallel with my studies, I did an internship at companies such as Yandex and Kaspersky, where I gained valuable practical experience in software development. In addition, I was actively involved in the development of web applications for private clients, participating in the implementation of large projects and their adaptation to various platforms. This experience allowed me not only to strengthen the theoretical knowledge gained at the academy, but also to develop skills for independent work, solving complex problems and working in a team.</p>
